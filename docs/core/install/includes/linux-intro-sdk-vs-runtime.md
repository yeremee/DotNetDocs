Install the SDK (which includes the runtime) if you want to develop .NET apps. Or, if you only need to run apps, install the runtime. If you're installing the runtime, we suggest you install the **ASP.NET Core runtime** as it includes both .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

If you've already installed the SDK or runtime, use the `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` commands to see which versions are installed. For more information, see [How to check that .NET Core is already installed](../how-to-detect-installed-versions.md).
