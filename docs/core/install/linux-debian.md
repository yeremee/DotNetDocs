# Install .NET Core SDK or .NET Core Runtime on Debian

This article describes how to install .NET Core on Debian. When a Debian version falls out of support, .NET Core is no longer supported with that version. However, these instructions may help you to get .NET Core running on those versions, even though it isn't supported.

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET Core releases and the versions of Debian they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET Core reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of [Debian reaches end-of-life](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases).

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of Debian or .NET Core is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of Debian or .NET Core isn't supported on that Debian release.
- When both a version of Debian and a version of .NET Core have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination are supported.

| Debian                   | .NET Core 2.1 | .NET Core 3.1 | .NET 5 Preview (manual install only) |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| ✔️ [10](#debian-10-)     | ✔️ 2.1        | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0 Preview |
| ✔️ [9](#debian-9-)       | ✔️ 2.1        | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0 Preview |
| ❌ [8](#debian-8-)       | ✔️ 2.1        | ❌ 3.1        | ❌ 5.0 Preview |

The following versions of .NET Core are no longer supported. The downloads for these still remain published:

- 3.0
- 2.2
- 2.0

## APT update SDK or runtime

When a new patch release is available for .NET Core, you can simply upgrade it through APT with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## APT troubleshooting

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using APT to install .NET Core.

### Unable to locate \\ Some packages could not be installed

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-find-deb](includes/package-manager-failed-to-find-deb.md)]

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gpg
wget -O - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor -o microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.asc.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/{os-version}/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo apt-get update; \
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \
  sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y {dotnet-package}
```

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET Core or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- libc6
- libgcc1
- libgssapi-krb5-2
- libicu52 (for 8.x)
- libicu57 (for 9.x)
- libicu63 (for 10.x)
- libicu67 (for 11.x)
- libssl1.0.0 (for 8.x)
- libssl1.1 (for 9.x-11.x)
- libstdc++6
- zlib1g

For .NET Core apps that use the *System.Drawing.Common* assembly, you also need the following dependency:

- libgdiplus (version 6.0.1 or later)

  > [!WARNING]
  > You can install a recent version of *libgdiplus* by adding the Mono repository to your system. For more information, see <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/>.
