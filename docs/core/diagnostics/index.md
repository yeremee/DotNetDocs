# What diagnostic tools are available in .NET Core?

Software doesn't always behave as you would expect, but .NET Core has tools and APIs that will help you diagnose these issues quickly and effectively.

This article helps you find the various tools you need.

## Managed debuggers

[Managed debuggers](managed-debuggers.md) allow you to interact with your program. Pausing, incrementally executing, examining,  and resuming gives you insight into the behavior of your code. A debugger is the first choice for diagnosing functional problems that can be easily reproduced.

## Logging and tracing

[Logging and tracing](logging-tracing.md) are related techniques. They refer to instrumenting code to create log files. The files record the details of what a program does. These details can be used to diagnose the most complex problems. When combined with time stamps, these techniques are also valuable in performance investigations.

## Unit testing

[Unit testing](../testing/index.md) is a key component of continuous integration and deployment of high-quality software. Unit tests are designed to give you an early warning when you break something.

## Debug Linux dumps

[Debug Linux dumps](debug-linux-dumps.md) explains how to collect and analyze dumps on Linux.

## .NET Core diagnostic global tools

### dotnet-counters

[dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md) is a performance monitoring tool for first-level health monitoring and performance investigation. It observes performance counter values published via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventCounter> API. For example, you can quickly monitor things like the CPU usage or the rate of exceptions being thrown in your .NET Core application.

### dotnet-dump

The [dotnet-dump](dotnet-dump.md) tool is a way to collect and analyze Windows and Linux core dumps without a native debugger.

### dotnet-gcdump

The [dotnet-gcdump](dotnet-gcdump.md) tool is a way to collect GC (Garbage Collector) dumps of live .NET processes.

### dotnet-trace

.NET Core includes what is called the `EventPipe` through which diagnostics data is exposed. The [dotnet-trace](dotnet-trace.md) tool allows you to consume interesting profiling data from your app that can help in scenarios where you need to root cause apps running slow.

### dotnet-symbol

[dotnet-symbol](dotnet-symbol.md) downloads files (symbols, DAC/DBI, host files, etc.) needed to open a core dump or minidump. Use this tool if you need symbols and modules to debug a dump file captured on a different machine.

### dotnet-sos

[dotnet-sos](dotnet-sos.md) is used to install the [SOS debugging extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/tools/sos-dll-sos-debugging-extension) on Linux or MacOS (or on Windows if using older debugging tools).

## .NET Core diagnostics tutorials

### Debug a memory leak

[Tutorial: Debug a memory leak](debug-memory-leak.md) walks through finding a memory leak. The [dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md) tool is used to confirm the leak and the [dotnet-dump](dotnet-dump.md) tool is used to diagnose the leak.

### Debug high CPU usage

[Tutorial: Debug high CPU usage](debug-highcpu.md) walks you through investigating high CPU usage. It uses the [dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md) tool to confirm the high CPU usage. It then walks you through using [Trace for performance analysis utility (`dotnet-trace`)](dotnet-trace.md) or Linux `perf` to collect and view CPU usage profile.

### Debug deadlock

[Tutorial: Debug deadlock](debug-deadlock.md) shows you how to use the [dotnet-dump](dotnet-dump.md) tool to investigate threads and locks.
