# Encrypting Data

Symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption are performed using different processes. Symmetric encryption is performed on streams and is therefore useful to encrypt large amounts of data. Asymmetric encryption is performed on a small number of bytes and is therefore useful only for small amounts of data.  
  
## Symmetric Encryption  

The managed symmetric cryptography classes are used with a special stream class called a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream> that encrypts data read into the stream. The **CryptoStream** class is initialized with a managed stream class, a class that implements the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.ICryptoTransform> interface (created from a class that implements a cryptographic algorithm), and a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode> enumeration that describes the type of access permitted to the **CryptoStream**. The **CryptoStream** class can be initialized using any class that derives from the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class, including <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream>, and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream>. Using these classes, you can perform symmetric encryption on a variety of stream objects.  
  
The following example illustrates how to create a new instance of the default implementation class for the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Aes> algorithm. The instance is used to perform encryption on a **CryptoStream** class. In this example, the **CryptoStream** is initialized with a stream object called `myStream` that can be any type of managed stream. The **CreateEncryptor** method from the **Aes** class is passed the key and IV that are used for encryption. In this case, the default key and IV generated from `aes` are used.
  
```vb  
Dim aes As Aes = Aes.Create()  
Dim cryptStream As New CryptoStream(myStream, aes.CreateEncryptor(key, iv), CryptoStreamMode.Write)  
```  
  
```csharp  
Aes aes = Aes.Create();  
CryptoStream cryptStream = new CryptoStream(myStream, aes.CreateEncryptor(key, iv), CryptoStreamMode.Write);  
```  
  
After this code is executed, any data written to the **CryptoStream** object is encrypted using the AES algorithm.  
  
The following example shows the entire process of creating a stream, encrypting the stream, writing to the stream, and closing the stream. This example creates a file stream that is encrypted using the **CryptoStream** class and the **Aes** class. A message is written to the encrypted stream with the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> class.
  
:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/encrypting-data/csharp/aes-encrypt.cs":::
:::code language="vb" source="snippets/encrypting-data/vb/aes-encrypt.vb":::

The code encrypts the stream using the AES symmetric algorithm, and writes "Hello World!" to the stream. If the code is successful, it creates an encrypted file named *TestData.txt* and displays the following text to the console:  
  
```console  
The text was encrypted.  
```  

You can decrypt the file by using the symmetric decryption example in [Decrypting Data](decrypting-data.md). That example and this example specify the same key and IV.

However, if an exception is raised, the code displays the following text to the console:  
  
```console  
The encryption failed.  
```

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric algorithms are usually used to encrypt small amounts of data such as the encryption of a symmetric key and IV. Typically, an individual performing asymmetric encryption uses the public key generated by another party. The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSA> class is provided by .NET for this purpose.  
  
The following example uses public key information to encrypt a symmetric key and IV. Two byte arrays are initialized that represent the public key of a third party. An <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSAParameters> object is initialized to these values. Next, the **RSAParameters** object (along with the public key it represents) is imported into an **RSA** instance using the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSA.ImportParameters%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. Finally, the private key and IV created by an <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Aes> class are encrypted. This example requires systems to have 128-bit encryption installed.  
  
```vb

Imports System.Security.Cryptography

    Sub Main()
        'Initialize the byte arrays to the public key information.

        Dim exponent As Byte() = {1, 0, 1}

        'Create values to store encrypted symmetric keys.  
        Dim encryptedSymmetricKey() As Byte
        Dim encryptedSymmetricIV() As Byte

        'Create a new instance of the default RSA implementation class.
        Dim rsa As RSA = RSA.Create()

        'Create a new instance of the RSAParameters structure.  
        Dim rsaKeyInfo As New RSAParameters()

        'Set rsaKeyInfo to the public key values.
        rsaKeyInfo.Modulus = modulus
        rsaKeyInfo.Exponent = exponent

        'Import key parameters into rsa
        rsa.ImportParameters(rsaKeyInfo)

        'Create a new instance of the default Aes implementation class.  
        Dim aes As Aes = Aes.Create()

        'Encrypt the symmetric key and IV.  
        encryptedSymmetricKey = rsa.Encrypt(aes.Key, RSAEncryptionPadding.Pkcs1)
        encryptedSymmetricIV = rsa.Encrypt(aes.IV, RSAEncryptionPadding.Pkcs1)
