# Using TPL with Other Asynchronous Patterns
The Task Parallel Library can be used with traditional .NET Framework asynchronous programming patterns in various ways.  
  
## In This Section  
 [TPL and Traditional .NET Framework Asynchronous Programming](tpl-and-traditional-async-programming.md)  
 Describes how <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> objects may be used in conjunction with the Asynchronous Programming Model (APM) and the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP).  
  
 [How to: Wrap EAP Patterns in a Task](how-to-wrap-eap-patterns-in-a-task.md)  
 Shows how to use <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> objects to encapsulate EAP patterns.
