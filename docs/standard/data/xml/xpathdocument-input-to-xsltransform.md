# XPathDocument Input to XslTransform
The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> is a read-only cache, for processing documents with <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform>. It is structurally similar to the XML Document Object Model (DOM), but it is highly optimized for Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) processing and the XML Path Language (XPath) data model using the XPath optimization functions on the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class is obsolete in the .NET Framework 2.0. You can perform Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) transformations using the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform> class. See [Using the XslCompiledTransform Class](using-the-xslcompiledtransform-class.md) and [Migrating From the XslTransform Class](migrating-from-the-xsltransform-class.md) for more information.  
  
 The following code sample creates an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> as input to a transform.  
  
```vb  
Dim xslt as XslTransform = new XslTransform()  
Xslt.Load(someStylesheet)  
Dim doc as XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("books.xml")  
Dim fs as StringWriter = new StringWriter()  
Xslt.Transform(doc, Nothing, fs, Nothing);  
```  
  
```csharp  
XslTransform xslt = new XslTransform();  
Xslt.Load(someStylesheet);  
XPathDocument doc = XPathDocument("books.xml");  
StringWriter fs = new StringWriter();  
Xslt.Transform(doc, null, fs, null);  
```
