# Azure tools for developing with .NET

## SDK downloads

Azure libraries for .NET are implemented as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=windowsazureofficial). See the [API Reference](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/?view=azure-dotnet) for reference documentation organized by Azure service.

## Development tools

Visual Studio has tooling for many Azure services built-in. Some Azure services have additional tools or emulators available, such as [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). See the documentation for your Azure service for any additional tools, if necessary.

Select your preferred development environment below.

## [Visual Studio on Windows](#tab/vs)

Visual Studio version 2017 and later have built-in support for Azure development. The below steps describe enabling Azure development support in Visual Studio.

For Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, <a href="vs2015-install.md">follow these instructions</a>.

### Step 1: Download Visual Studio 2019

You can skip this step if you already have Visual Studio 2019 installed.
