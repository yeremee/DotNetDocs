# Load training data into Model Builder

Learn how to load your training datasets from a file or a SQL Server database for use in one of the Model Builder scenarios for ML.NET. Model Builder scenarios can use SQL Server databases, image files, and CSV or TSV file formats as training data.

## Training dataset limitations in Model Builder

Model Builder limits the amount and type of data you can use for training models:

- SQL Server data: 100,000 rows
- CSV and TSV files: No size limit
- Images: PNG and JPG only.

## Model Builder scenarios

Model Builder helps you create models for the following machine learning scenarios:

- Sentiment analysis (binary classification): Classify textual data into two categories.
- Issue classification (multiclass classification): Classify textual data into 3 or more categories.
- Price prediction (regression): Predict a numeric value.
- Image classification (deep learning): Categorize images based on characteristics.
- Custom scenario: Build custom scenarios from your data using regression, classification, and other tasks.

This article covers classification and regression scenarios with textual or numerical data, and image classification scenarios.

## Load text or numeric data from a file

You can load text or numeric data from a file into Model Builder. It accepts comma-delimited (CSV) or tab-delimited (TSV) file formats.

1. In the data step of Model Builder, select **File** from the data source dropdown.
2. Select the button next to the **Select a file** text box, and use File Explorer to browse and select the data file.
3. Choose a category in the **Column to Predict (Label)** dropdown.
4. From the **Input Columns (Features)** dropdown, confirm the data columns you want to include are checked.

You're done setting up your data source file for Model Builder. Select the **Train** link to move to the next step in Model Builder.

## Load data from a SQL Server database

Model Builder supports loading data from local and remote SQL Server databases.

To load data from a SQL Server database into Module Builder:

1. In the data step of Model Builder, select **SQL Server** from the data source dropdown.
1. Select the button next to the **Connect to SQL Server database** text box.
    1. In the **Choose Data** dialog, select **Microsoft SQL Server Database File**.
    1. Uncheck the **Always use this selection** checkbox and select **Continue**
    1. In the **Connection Properties** dialog, select **Browse** and select the downloaded .MDF file.
    1. Select **OK**
1. Choose the dataset name from the **Table Name** dropdown.
1. From the **Column to Predict (Label)** dropdown, choose the data category on which you want to make a prediction.
1. From the **Input Columns (Features)** dropdown, confirm the columns you want to include are checked.

You're done setting up your data source file for Model Builder. Select the **Train** link to move to the next step in Model Builder.

## Set up image data files

Model Builder expects image data to be JPG or PNG files organized in folders that correspond to the categories of the classification.

To load images into Model Builder, provide the path to a single top-level directory:

- This top-level directory contains one subfolder for each of the categories to predict.
- Each subfolder contains the image files belonging to its category.

In the folder structure illustrated below, the top-level directory is *flower_photos*. There are five subdirectories corresponding to the categories you want to predict: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips. Each of these subdirectories contains images belonging to its respective category.
