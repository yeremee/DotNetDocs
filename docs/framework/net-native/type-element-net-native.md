# \<Type> Element (.NET Native)

Applies runtime policy to a particular type, such as a class or structure.

## Syntax

```xml
<Type Name="type_name"
      Activate="policy_type"
      Browse="policy_type"
      Dynamic="policy_type"
      Serialize="policy_type"
      DataContractSerializer="policy_setting"
      DataContractJsonSerializer="policy_setting"
      XmlSerializer="policy_setting"
      MarshalObject="policy_setting"
      MarshalDelegate="policy_setting"
      MarshalStructure="policy_setting" />
```

## Attributes and Elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|Attribute|Attribute type|Description|
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
|`Name`|General|Required attribute. Specifies the type name.|
|`Activate`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors to enable activation of instances.|
|`Browse`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls querying for information about program elements, but does not enable any runtime access.|
|`Dynamic`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to all type members, including constructors, methods, fields, properties, and events, to enable dynamic programming.|
|`Serialize`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors, fields, and properties, to enable type instances to be serialized and deserialized by libraries such as the Newtonsoft JSON serializer.|
|`DataContractSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer?displayProperty=nameWithType> class.|
|`DataContractJsonSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for JSON serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer?displayProperty=nameWithType> class.|
|`XmlSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for XML serialization that uses the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer?displayProperty=nameWithType> class.|
|`MarshalObject`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling reference types to Windows Runtime and COM.|
|`MarshalDelegate`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling delegate types as function pointers to native code.|
|`MarshalStructure`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling value types to native code.|

## Name attribute

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|*type_name*|The type name. If this `<Type>` element is the child of either a [\<Namespace>](namespace-element-net-native.md) element or another `<Type>` element, *type_name* can include the name of the type without its namespace. Otherwise, *type_name* must include the fully qualified type name.|

## All other attributes

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|*policy_setting*|The setting to apply to this policy type. Possible values are `All`, `Auto`, `Excluded`, `Public`, `PublicAndInternal`, `Required Public`, `Required PublicAndInternal`, and `Required All`. For more information, see [Runtime Directive Policy Settings](runtime-directive-policy-settings.md).|

### Child Elements

|Element|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|[\<AttributeImplies>](attributeimplies-element-net-native.md)|If the containing type is an attribute, defines runtime policy for code elements to which the attribute is applied.|
|[\<Event>](event-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to an event belonging to this type.|
|[\<Field>](field-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a field belonging to this type.|
|[\<GenericParameter>](genericparameter-element-net-native.md)|Applies policy to the parameter type of a generic type.|
|[\<ImpliesType>](impliestype-element-net-native.md)|Applies policy to a type, if that policy has been applied to the type represented by the containing `<Type>` element.|
|[\<Method>](method-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a method belonging to this type.|
|[\<MethodInstantiation>](methodinstantiation-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a constructed generic method belonging to this type.|
|[\<Property>](property-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a property belonging to this type.|
|[\<Subtypes>](subtypes-element-net-native.md)|Applies runtime policy to all classes inherited from the containing type.|
|`<Type>`|Applies reflection policy to a nested type.|
|[\<TypeInstantiation>](typeinstantiation-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a constructed generic type.|

### Parent Elements

|Element|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|[\<Application>](application-element-net-native.md)|Serves as a container for application-wide types and type members whose metadata is available for reflection at run time.|
|[\<Assembly>](assembly-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to all the types in a specified assembly.|
|[\<Library>](library-element-net-native.md)|Defines the assembly that contains types and type members whose metadata is available for reflection at run time.|
|[\<Namespace>](namespace-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to all the types in a namespace.|
|`<Type>`|Applies reflection policy to a type and all its members.|
|[\<TypeInstantiation>](typeinstantiation-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a constructed generic type and all its members.|

## Remarks

The reflection, serialization, and interop attributes are all optional. If none are present, the `<Type>` element serves as a container whose child types define policy for individual members.

If a `<Type>` element is the child of an [\<Assembly>](assembly-element-net-native.md), [\<Namespace>](namespace-element-net-native.md), `<Type>`, or [\<TypeInstantiation>](typeinstantiation-element-net-native.md) element, it overrides the policy settings defined by the parent element.

A `<Type>` element of a generic type applies its policy to all instantiations that do not have their own policy. The policy of constructed generic types is defined by the [\<TypeInstantiation>](typeinstantiation-element-net-native.md) element.

If the type is a generic type, its name is decorated by a grave accent symbol (\`) followed by its number of generic parameters. For example, the `Name` attribute of a `<Type>` element for the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> class appears as ``Name="System.Collections.Generic.List`1"``.

## Example

The following example uses reflection to display information about the fields, properties, and methods of the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> class. The variable `b` in the example is a <xref:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock> control. Because the example simply retrieves type information, the availability of metadata is controlled by the `Browse` policy setting.

 [!code-csharp[ProjectN_Reflection#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/projectn_reflection/cs/browsegenerictype1.cs#3)]

 Because metadata for the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> class isn't automatically included by the .NET Native tool chain, the example fails to display the requested member information at run time. To provide the necessary metadata, add the following `<Type>` element to the runtime directives file. Note that, because we've provided a parent [<Namespace\>](namespace-element-net-native.md) element, we don't have to provide a fully qualified type name in the `<Type>` element.

```xml
<Directives xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2013/01/metadata">
   <Application>
      <Assembly Name="*Application*" Dynamic="Required All" />
      <Namespace Name ="System.Collections.Generic" >
        <Type Name="List`1" Browse="Required All" />
     </Namespace>
   </Application>
</Directives>
```

## Example
 The following example uses reflection to retrieve a <xref:System.Reflection.PropertyInfo> object that represents the <xref:System.String.Chars%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. It then uses the <xref:System.Reflection.PropertyInfo.GetValue%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to retrieve the value of the seventh character in a string, and to display all the characters in the string. The variable `b` in the example is a <xref:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock> control.

 [!code-csharp[ProjectN_Reflection#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/projectn_reflection/cs/propertyinfo1.cs#1)]

 Because metadata for the <xref:System.String> object isn't available, the call to the <xref:System.Reflection.PropertyInfo.GetValue%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=nameWithType> method throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception at run time when compiled with the .NET Native tool chain. To eliminate the exception and provide the necessary metadata, add the following `<Type>` element to the runtime directives file:

```xml
<Directives xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2013/01/metadata">
  <Application>
    <Assembly Name="*Application*" Dynamic="Required All" />
    <Type Name="System.String" Dynamic="Required Public"/> -->
  </Application>
</Directives>
```
