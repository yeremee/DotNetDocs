# How to: Install and uninstall Windows services

If you’re developing a Windows service with the .NET Framework, you can quickly install your service app by using the [*InstallUtil.exe*](../tools/installutil-exe-installer-tool.md) command-line utility or [PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/overview). Developers who want to release a Windows service that users can install and uninstall can use the free [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) or commercial tools like [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/), [InstallShield](https://www.revenera.com/install/products/installshield.html), or others. For more information, see [Create an installer package (Windows desktop)](/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-applications-services-and-components#create-an-installer-package-windows-desktop).

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to uninstall a service from your computer, don’t follow the steps in this article. Instead, find out which program or software package installed the service, and then choose **Apps** in Settings to uninstall that program. Note that many services are integral parts of Windows; if you remove them, you might cause system instability.

To use the steps in this article, you first need to add a service installer to your Windows service. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Windows service app](walkthrough-creating-a-windows-service-application-in-the-component-designer.md).

You can't run Windows service projects directly from the Visual Studio development environment by pressing F5. Before you can run the project, you must install the service in the project.

> [!TIP]
> You can use **Server Explorer** to verify that you've installed or uninstalled your service. For more information, see [How to use Server Explorer in Visual Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/help/316649/how-to-use-the-server-explorer-in-visual-studio-net-and-visual-studio).

### Install your service manually using InstallUtil.exe utility

1. From the **Start** menu, select the **Visual Studio \<*version*>** directory, then select **Developer Command Prompt for VS \<*version*>**.

     The Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio appears.

2. Access the directory where your project's compiled executable file is located.

3. Run *InstallUtil.exe* from the command prompt with your project's executable as a parameter:

    ```console
    installutil <yourproject>.exe
    ```

     If you’re using the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio, *InstallUtil.exe* should be on the system path. Otherwise, you can add it to the path, or use the fully qualified path to invoke it. This tool is installed with the .NET Framework in *%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework[64]\\<framework_version\>*.

     For example:
     - For the 32-bit version of the .NET Framework 4 or 4.5 and later, if your Windows installation directory is *C:\Windows*, the default path is *C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe*.
     - For the 64-bit version of the .NET Framework 4 or 4.5 and later, the default path is *C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe*.

### Uninstall your service manually using InstallUtil.exe utility

1. From the **Start** menu, select the **Visual Studio \<*version*>** directory, then select **Developer Command Prompt for VS \<*version*>**.

     The Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio appears.

2. Run *InstallUtil.exe* from the command prompt with your project's output as a parameter:

    ```console
    installutil /u <yourproject>.exe
    ```

3. After the executable for a service is deleted, the service might still be present in the registry. If that's the case, use the command [sc delete](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-delete) to remove the entry for the service from the registry.

### Install your service manually using PowerShell

1. From the **Start** menu, select the **Windows PowerShell** directory, then select **Windows PowerShell**.

2. Access the directory where your project's compiled executable file is located.

3. Run the [**New-Service**](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-service) cmdlet with the with your project's output and a service name as parameters:

    ```powershell
    New-Service -Name "YourServiceName" -BinaryPathName <yourproject>.exe
    ```

### Uninstall your service manually using PowerShell

1. From the **Start** menu, select the **Windows PowerShell** directory, then select **Windows PowerShell**.

2. Run the [**Remove-Service**](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/remove-service) cmdlet with the name of your service as parameter:

    ```powershell
    Remove-Service -Name "YourServiceName"
    ```

3. After the executable for a service is deleted, the service might still be present in the registry. If that's the case, use the command [sc delete](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-delete) to remove the entry for the service from the registry.

    ```powershell
    sc.exe delete "YourServiceName"
    ```
