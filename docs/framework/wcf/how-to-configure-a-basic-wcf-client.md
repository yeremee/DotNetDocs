# How to: Configure a Basic Windows Communication Foundation Client

This is the fifth of six tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. For an overview of all six of the tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.

This topic discusses the client configuration file that was generated using the **Add Service Reference** functionality of Visual Studio or the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md). Configuring the client consists of specifying the endpoint that the client uses to access the service. An endpoint has an address, a binding, and a contract, and each of these must be specified in the process of configuring the client.

## Configure a Windows Communication Foundation client

Open the generated configuration file (App.config) from the GettingStartedClient project. The following example is a view of the generated configuration file. Under the [\<system.serviceModel>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/system-servicemodel.md) section, find the [\<endpoint>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/13aa23b7-2f08-4add-8dbf-a99f8127c017) element.

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        <startup>
          <!-- specifies the version of WCF to use-->
            <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5,Profile=Client" />
        </startup>
        <system.serviceModel>
            <bindings>
                <!-- Uses wsHttpBinding-->
                <wsHttpBinding>
                    <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" />
                </wsHttpBinding>
            </bindings>
            <client>
                <!-- specifies the endpoint to use when calling the service -->
                <endpoint address="http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService"
                    binding="wsHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"
                    contract="ServiceReference1.ICalculator" name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator">
                    <identity>
                        <userPrincipalName value="migree@redmond.corp.microsoft.com" />
                    </identity>
                </endpoint>
            </client>
        </system.serviceModel>
    </configuration>
```

This example configures the endpoint that the client uses to access the service that is located at the following address: `http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService`.

The endpoint element specifies that the `ServiceReference1.ICalculator` service contract is used for communication between the WCF client and service. The WCF channel is configured with the system-provided <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>. This contract was generated by using **Add Service Reference** in Visual Studio. It is essentially a copy of the contract that was defined in the GettingStartedLib project. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> binding specifies HTTP as the transport, interoperable security, and other configuration details.

For more information about how to use the generated client with this configuration, see [How to: Use a Client](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client.md).
