# How to: Implement a Windows Communication Foundation Service Contract

This is the second of six tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service and a client that can call the service. For an overview of all six tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.

The next step in creating a WCF application is to implement the service interface. This involves creating a class called `CalculatorService` that implements the user-defined `ICalculator` interface..

## To implement a WCF service contract

Open the Service1.cs or Service1.vb file and add the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace GettingStartedLib
{
    public class CalculatorService : ICalculator
    {
        public double Add(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 + n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            // Code added to write output to the console window.
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 - n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 * n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Divide(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 / n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System.ServiceModel

Namespace GettingStartedLib

    Public Class CalculatorService
        Implements ICalculator

        Public Function Add(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Add
            Dim result As Double = n1 + n2
            ' Code added to write output to the console window.
            Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2)
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)
            Return result
        End Function

        Public Function Subtract(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Subtract
            Dim result As Double = n1 - n2
            Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2)
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)
            Return result

        End Function

        Public Function Multiply(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Multiply
            Dim result As Double = n1 * n2
            Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2)
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)
            Return result

        End Function

        Public Function Divide(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Divide
            Dim result As Double = n1 / n2
            Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2)
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)
            Return result

        End Function
    End Class
End Namespace
```

Each method implements the calculator operation and writes some text to the console to make testing easier.

## Example

The following code shows both the interface that defines the contract and the implementation of the interface.

```csharp
using System;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace GettingStartedLib
{
    [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]
    public interface ICalculator
    {
        [OperationContract]
        double Add(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Subtract(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Multiply(double n1, double n2);
        [OperationContract]
        double Divide(double n1, double n2);
    }
}
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace GettingStartedLib
{
    public class CalculatorService : ICalculator
    {
        public double Add(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 + n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            // Code added to write output to the console window.
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 - n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 * n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }

        public double Divide(double n1, double n2)
        {
            double result = n1 / n2;
            Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2);
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

## Compile the code

Build the solution to ensure there are no compilation errors. If you're using Visual Studio, on the **Build** menu select **Build Solution** (or press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**B**).

## Next steps

Now the service contract is created and implemented. In the next step, you run the service.
