# Throttled Parallel ForEach

The `ThrottleParallelForEach` activity is similar to the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601> activity with the one exception that it allows setting a concurrency factor to restrict the number of simultaneous branches to execute. The `ThrottleParallelForEach` activity derives from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>, because it needs to schedule other activities (the child activities) and this is only accessible through the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext> class.
