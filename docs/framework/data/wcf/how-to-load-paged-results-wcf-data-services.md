# How to: Load Paged Results (WCF Data Services)
WCF Data Services enables the data service to limit the number of entities that are returned in a single response feed. When this happens, the final entry in the feed contains a link to the next page of data. The URI for the next page of data is obtained by calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601.GetContinuation%2A> method of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601>, which is returned when the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> is executed. The URI represented by this object is then used to load the next page of results. For more information, see [Loading Deferred Content](loading-deferred-content-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example uses a `do…while` loop to load `Customers` entities from a paged results from the data service.

 [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#GetCustomersPaged](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria_northwind_client/vb/source.vb#getcustomerspaged)]  
  
## Example  
 This example returns related `Orders` entities with each `Customers` entity and uses a `do…while` loop to load `Customers` entities pages and a nested `while` loop to load pages of related `Orders` entities from the data service.
