# Identifier names

An **identifier** is the name you assign to a type (class, interface, struct, delegate, or enum), member, variable, or namespace. Valid identifiers must follow these rules:

- Identifiers must start with a letter, or `_`.
- Identifiers may contain Unicode letter characters, decimal digit characters, Unicode connecting characters, Unicode combining characters, or Unicode formatting characters. For more information on Unicode categories, see the [Unicode Category Database](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/).
You can declare identifiers that match C# keywords by using the `@` prefix on the identifier. The `@` is not part of the identifier name. For example, `@if` declares an identifier named `if`. These [verbatim identifiers](../../language-reference/tokens/verbatim.md) are primarily for interoperability with identifiers declared in other languages.

For a complete definition of valid identifiers, see the [Identifiers topic in the C# Language Specification](../../../../_csharplang/spec/lexical-structure.md#identifiers).

## Naming conventions

In addition to the rules, there are a number of identifier [naming conventions](../../../standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines.md) used throughout the .NET APIs. By convention, C# programs use `PascalCase` for type names, namespaces, and all public members. In addition, the following conventions are common:

- Interface names start with a capital `I`.
- Attribute types end with the word `Attribute`.
- Enum types use a singular noun for non-flags, and a plural noun for flags.
- Identifiers should not contain two consecutive `_` characters. Those names are reserved for compiler generated identifiers.
