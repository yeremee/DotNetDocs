# Write safe and efficient C# code

New features in C# enable you to write verifiable safe code with better performance. If you carefully apply these techniques, fewer scenarios require unsafe code. These features make it easier to use references to value types as method arguments and method returns. When done safely, these techniques minimize copying value types. By using value types, you can minimize the number of allocations and garbage collection passes.

Much of the sample code in this article uses features added in C# 7.2. To
use those features, you must configure your project to use C# 7.2 or later. For more information on setting the language version, see [configure the language version](language-reference/configure-language-version.md).

This article focuses on techniques for efficient resource management. One advantage to using value types is that they often avoid heap allocations. The disadvantage is that they're copied by value. This trade-off makes it harder to optimize algorithms that operate on large amounts of data. New language features in C# 7.2 provide mechanisms that enable safe efficient code using references to value types. Use these features wisely to minimize both allocations and copy operations. This article explores those new features.

This article focuses on the following resource management techniques:

- Declare a [`readonly struct`](language-reference/builtin-types/struct.md#readonly-struct) to express that a type is **immutable**. That enables the compiler to save defensive copies when using [`in`](language-reference/keywords/in-parameter-modifier.md) parameters.
- If a type can't be immutable, declare `struct` members [`readonly`](language-reference/builtin-types/struct.md#readonly-instance-members) to indicate that the member doesn't modify state.
- Use a [`ref readonly`](language-reference/keywords/ref.md#reference-return-values) return when the return value is a `struct` larger than <xref:System.IntPtr.Size?displayProperty=nameWithType> and the storage lifetime is greater than the method returning the value.
- When the size of a `readonly struct` is bigger than <xref:System.IntPtr.Size?displayProperty=nameWithType>, you should pass it as an `in` parameter for performance reasons.
- Never pass a `struct` as an `in` parameter unless it's declared with the `readonly` modifier or the method calls only `readonly` members of the struct. Violating this guidance may negatively affect performance and could lead to an obscure behavior.
- Use a [`ref struct`](language-reference/builtin-types/struct.md#ref-struct), or a `readonly ref struct` such as <xref:System.Span%601> or <xref:System.ReadOnlySpan%601> to work with memory as a sequence of bytes.

These techniques force you to balance two competing goals with regard to **references** and **values**. Variables that are [reference types](programming-guide/types/index.md#reference-types) hold a reference to the location in memory. Variables that are [value types](programming-guide/types/index.md#value-types) directly contain their value. These differences highlight the key differences that are important for managing memory resources. **Value types** are typically copied when passed to a method or returned from a method. This behavior includes copying the value of `this` when calling members of a value type. The cost of the copy is related to the size of the type. **Reference types** are allocated on the managed heap. Each new object requires a new allocation, and subsequently must be reclaimed. Both these operations take time. The reference is copied when a reference type is passed as an argument to a method or returned from a method.

This article uses the following example concept of the 3D-point structure to explain these recommendations:

```csharp
public struct Point3D
{
    public double X;
    public double Y;
    public double Z;
}
```

Different examples use different implementations of this concept.

## Declare readonly structs for immutable value types

Declaring a `struct` using the `readonly` modifier informs the compiler that your intent is to create an immutable type. The compiler enforces that design decision with the following rules:

- All field members must be `readonly`
- All properties must be read-only, including auto-implemented properties.

These two rules are sufficient to ensure that no member of a `readonly struct` modifies the state of that struct. The `struct` is immutable. The `Point3D` structure could be defined as an immutable struct as shown in the following example:

```csharp
readonly public struct ReadonlyPoint3D
{
    public ReadonlyPoint3D(double x, double y, double z)
    {
        this.X = x;
        this.Y = y;
        this.Z = z;
    }

    public double X { get; }
    public double Y { get; }
    public double Z { get; }
}
```

Follow this recommendation whenever your design intent is to create an immutable value type. Any performance improvements are an added benefit. The `readonly struct` clearly expresses your design intent.

## Declare readonly members when a struct can't be immutable

In C# 8.0 and later, when a struct type is mutable, you should declare members that don't cause mutation to be `readonly`. Consider a different application that needs a 3D point structure, but must support mutability. The following version of the 3D point structure adds the `readonly` modifier only to those members that don't modify the structure. Follow this example when your design must support modifications to the struct by some members, but you still want the benefits of enforcing readonly on some members:

```csharp
public struct Point3D
{
    public Point3D(double x, double y, double z)
    {
        _x = x;
        _y = y;
        _z = z;
    }

    private double _x;
    public double X
    {
        readonly get => _x;
        set => _x = value;
    }

    private double _y;
    public double Y
    {
        readonly get => _y;
        set => _y = value;
    }

    private double _z;
    public double Z
    {
        readonly get => _z;
        set => _z = value;
    }

    public readonly double Distance => Math.Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y + Z * Z);

    public readonly override string ToString() => $"{X}, {Y}, {Z}";
}
```

The preceding sample shows many of the locations where you can apply the `readonly` modifier: methods, properties, and property accessors. If you use auto-implemented properties, the compiler adds the `readonly` modifier to the `get` accessor for read-write properties. The compiler adds the `readonly` modifier to the auto-implemented property declarations for properties with only a `get` accessor.

Adding the `readonly` modifier to members that don't mutate state provides two related benefits. First, the compiler enforces your intent. That member can't mutate the struct's state. Second, the compiler won't create defensive copies of `in` parameters when accessing a `readonly` member. The compiler can make this optimization safely because it guarantees that the `struct` is not modified by a `readonly` member.

## Use `ref readonly return` statements for large structures when possible

You can return values by reference when the value being returned isn't local to the returning method. Returning by reference means that only the reference is copied, not the structure. In the following example, the `Origin` property can't use a `ref` return because the value being returned is a local variable:

```csharp
public Point3D Origin => new Point3D(0,0,0);
```

However, the following property definition can be returned by reference because the returned value is a static member:

```csharp
public struct Point3D
{
    private static Point3D origin = new Point3D(0,0,0);

    // Dangerous! returning a mutable reference to internal storage
    public ref Point3D Origin => ref origin;

    // other members removed for space
}
```

You don't want callers modifying the origin, so you should return the value by `ref readonly`:

```csharp
public struct Point3D
{
    private static Point3D origin = new Point3D(0,0,0);

    public static ref readonly Point3D Origin => ref origin;

    // other members removed for space
}
```

Returning `ref readonly` enables you to save copying larger structures and preserve the immutability of your internal data members.

At the call site, callers make the choice to use the `Origin` property as a `ref readonly` or as a value:

[!code-csharp[AssignRefReadonly](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#AssignRefReadonly "Assigning a ref readonly")]

The first assignment in the preceding code makes a copy of the `Origin` constant and assigns
that copy. The second assigns a reference. Notice that the `readonly` modifier
must be part of the declaration of the variable. The reference to which it refers
can't be modified. Attempts to do so result in a compile-time error.

The `readonly` modifier is required on the declaration of `originReference`.

The compiler enforces that the caller can't modify the reference. Attempts
to assign the value directly generate a compile-time error. However, the compiler
can't know if any member method modifies the state of the struct.
To ensure that the object isn't modified, the compiler creates a copy and
calls member references using that copy. Any modifications are to that
defensive copy.

## Apply the `in` modifier to `readonly struct` parameters larger than `System.IntPtr.Size`

The `in` keyword complements the existing `ref`
and `out` keywords to pass arguments
by reference. The `in` keyword specifies passing
the argument by reference, but the called method doesn't modify
the value.

This addition provides a full vocabulary to express your design intent.
Value types are copied when passed to a called method when you don't
specify any of the following modifiers in the method signature. Each of these modifiers specifies
that a variable is passed by reference, avoiding the copy. Each modifier
expresses a different intent:

- `out`: This method sets the value of the argument used as this parameter.
- `ref`: This method may set the value of the argument used as this parameter.
- `in`: This method doesn't modify the value of the argument used as this parameter.

Add the `in` modifier to pass an argument by reference and declare
your design intent to pass arguments by reference to
avoid unnecessary copying. You don't intend to modify the object used
as that argument.

This practice often improves performance for readonly value types that are larger than <xref:System.IntPtr.Size?displayProperty=nameWithType>. For simple types (`sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal` and `bool`, and `enum` types), any potential performance gains are minimal. In fact, performance may degrade by using pass-by-reference for types smaller than <xref:System.IntPtr.Size?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

The following code shows an example of a method
that calculates the distance between two points in 3D space.

[!code-csharp[InArgument](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#InArgument "Specifying an in argument")]

The arguments are two structures that each contain three doubles. A double is 8 bytes,
so each argument is 24 bytes. By specifying the `in` modifier, you pass a 4 byte
or 8-byte reference to those arguments, depending on the
architecture of the machine. The difference in size is small, but it adds
up when your application calls this method in a tight loop using many different
values.

The `in` modifier complements `out` and `ref` in other ways as well. You
can't create overloads of a method that differ only in the presence of
`in`, `out`, or `ref`. These new rules extend the same behavior that had always been
defined for `out` and `ref` parameters. Like the `out` and `ref` modifiers, value types aren't boxed because the `in` modifier is applied.

The `in` modifier may be applied to any member that takes parameters:
methods, delegates, lambdas, local functions, indexers, operators.

Another feature of `in` parameters is that you may use literal values or constants
for the argument to an `in` parameter. Also, unlike a `ref` or `out` parameter,
you don't need to apply the `in` modifier at the call site. The following
code shows you two examples of calling the `CalculateDistance` method. The
first uses two local variables passed by reference. The second includes a
temporary variable created as part of the method call.

[!code-csharp[UseInArgument](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#UseInArgument "Specifying an In argument")]

There are several ways in which the compiler enforces the read-only
nature of an `in` argument.  First of all, the called method
can't directly assign to an `in` parameter. It can't directly assign
to any field of an `in` parameter when that value is a `struct` type. In addition, you can't pass
an `in` parameter to any method using the `ref` or `out` modifier.
These rules apply to any field of an `in` parameter, provided the
field is a `struct` type and the parameter is also a `struct` type. In fact, these rules
apply for multiple layers of member access provided the types at all levels
of member access are `structs`.
The compiler enforces that `struct` types passed as  `in` arguments and their
`struct` members are read-only variables when used as arguments to other methods.

The use of `in` parameters can avoid the potential performance costs
of making copies. It doesn't change the semantics of any method call. Therefore,
you don't need to specify the `in` modifier at the call site. Omitting the `in` modifier at the call site informs the compiler that it's
allowed to make a copy of the argument for the following reasons:

- There exists an implicit conversion but not an identity conversion from the argument type to the parameter type.
- The argument is an expression but doesn't have a known storage variable.
- An overload exists that differs by the presence or absence of `in`. In that case, the by value overload is a better match.

These rules are useful as you update existing code to use read-only
reference arguments. Inside the called method, you can call any instance
method that uses by value parameters. In
those instances, a copy of the `in` parameter is created. Because the compiler
may create a temporary variable for any `in` parameter, you can also specify default
values for any `in` parameter. The following code specifies the origin
(point 0,0) as the default value for the second point:

[!code-csharp[InArgumentDefault](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#InArgumentDefault "Specifying defaults for an in parameter")]

To force the compiler to pass read-only arguments by reference, specify the `in` modifier
on the arguments at the call site, as shown in the following code:

[!code-csharp[UseInArgument](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#ExplicitInArgument "Specifying an In argument")]

This behavior makes it easier to adopt `in` parameters over time in large
codebases where performance gains are possible. You add the `in` modifier
to method signatures first. Then, you can add the `in` modifier at call sites
and create `readonly struct` types to enable the compiler to avoid creating
defensive copies of `in` parameters in more locations.

The `in` parameter designation can also be used with reference types or numeric values. However, the benefits in both cases are minimal, if any.

## Avoid mutable structs as an `in` argument

The techniques described above explain how to avoid copies by returning references and passing values by reference. These techniques work best when the argument types are declared as `readonly struct` types. Otherwise, the compiler must create **defensive copies** in many situations to enforce the readonly-ness of any arguments. Consider the following example that calculates the distance of a 3D point from the origin:

[!code-csharp[InArgument](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#InArgument "Specifying an in argument")]

The `Point3D` structure is *not* a readonly struct. There are six different property access calls in the body of this method. On first examination, you may have thought these accesses were safe. After all, a `get` accessor shouldn't modify the state of the object. But there's no language rule that enforces that. It's only a common convention. Any type could implement a `get` accessor that modified the internal state. Without some language guarantee, the compiler must create a temporary copy of the argument before calling any member not marked with the `readonly` modifier. The temporary storage is created on the stack, the values of the argument are copied to the temporary storage, and the value is copied to the stack for each member access as the `this` argument. In many situations, these copies harm performance enough that pass-by-value is faster than pass-by-readonly-reference when the argument type isn't a `readonly struct` and the method calls members that aren't marked `readonly`. If you mark all methods that don't modify the struct state as `readonly`, the compiler can safely determine that the struct state isn't modified, and a defensive copy is not needed.

Instead, if the distance calculation uses the immutable struct, `ReadonlyPoint3D`, temporary objects aren't needed:

[!code-csharp[readonlyInArgument](../../samples/snippets/csharp/safe-efficient-code/ref-readonly-struct/Program.cs#ReadOnlyInArgument "Specifying a readonly in argument")]

The compiler generates more efficient code when you call members of a
`readonly struct`: The `this` reference, instead of a copy of the receiver,
is always an `in` parameter passed by reference to the member method. This optimization
saves copying when you use a `readonly struct` as an `in` argument.

You shouldn't pass a nullable value type as an `in` argument. The <xref:System.Nullable%601> type isn't declared as a read-only struct. That means the compiler must generate defensive copies for any nullable value type argument passed to a method using the `in` modifier on the parameter declaration.

You can see an example program that demonstrates the performance differences using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BenchmarkDotNet/) in our [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/csharp/safe-efficient-code/benchmark) on GitHub. It compares passing a mutable struct by value and by reference with passing an immutable struct by value and by reference. The use of the immutable struct and pass by reference is fastest.

## Use `ref struct` types to work with blocks or memory on a single stack frame

A related language feature is the ability to declare a value type that
must be constrained to a single stack frame. This restriction enables the compiler to make several optimizations. The primary motivation for this feature
was <xref:System.Span%601> and related structures. You'll achieve performance improvements from these enhancements by using new and updated .NET APIs that make use of the <xref:System.Span%601> type.

You may have similar requirements working with memory created using [`stackalloc`](language-reference/operators/stackalloc.md) or when using memory from interop APIs. You can define your own `ref struct` types for those needs.

## `readonly ref struct` type

Declaring a struct as `readonly ref` combines the benefits and restrictions of `ref struct` and `readonly struct` declarations. The memory used by the readonly span is restricted to a single stack frame, and the memory used by the readonly span can't be modified.

## Conclusions

Using value types minimizes the number of allocation operations:

- Storage for value types is stack allocated for local variables and method arguments.
- Storage for value types that are members of other objects is allocated as part of that object, not as a separate allocation.
- Storage for value type return values is stack allocated.

Contrast that with reference types in those same situations:

- Storage for reference types are heap allocated for local variables and method arguments. The reference is stored on the stack.
- Storage for reference types that are members of other objects are separately allocated on the heap. The containing object stores the reference.
- Storage for reference type return values is heap allocated. The reference to that storage is stored on the stack.

Minimizing allocations comes with tradeoffs. You copy more memory when the size of the `struct` is larger than the size of a reference. A reference is typically 64 bits or 32 bits, and depends on the target machine CPU.

These tradeoffs generally have minimal performance impact. However, for large structs or larger collections, the performance impact increases. The impact can be large in tight loops and hot paths for programs.

These enhancements to the C# language are designed for performance critical
algorithms where minimizing memory allocations is a major factor in achieving the
necessary performance. You may find that you don't often use these features in
the code you write. However, these enhancements have been adopted throughout .NET. As more and more APIs make use of these features, you'll
see the performance of your applications improve.
