# ?: operator (C# reference)

The conditional operator `?:`, also known as the ternary conditional operator, evaluates a Boolean expression and returns the result of one of the two expressions, depending on whether the Boolean expression evaluates to `true` or `false`.

The syntax for the conditional operator is as follows:

```csharp
condition ? consequent : alternative
```

The `condition` expression must evaluate to `true` or `false`. If `condition` evaluates to `true`, the `consequent` expression is evaluated, and its result becomes the result of the operation. If `condition` evaluates to `false`, the `alternative` expression is evaluated, and its result becomes the result of the operation. Only `consequent` or `alternative` is evaluated.

The type of `consequent` and `alternative` must be the same, or there must be an implicit conversion from one type to the other.

The conditional operator is right-associative, that is, an expression of the form

```csharp
a ? b : c ? d : e
```

is evaluated as

```csharp
a ? b : (c ? d : e)
```

The following example demonstrates the usage of the conditional operator:

## Conditional ref expression

Beginning with C# 7.2, a [ref local](../keywords/ref.md#ref-locals) or [ref readonly local](../keywords/ref.md#ref-readonly-locals) variable can be assigned conditionally with the conditional ref expression. You can also use the conditional ref expression as a [reference return value](../keywords/ref.md#reference-return-values) or as a [`ref` method argument](../keywords/ref.md#passing-an-argument-by-reference).

The syntax for the conditional ref expression is as follows:

```csharp
condition ? ref consequent : ref alternative
```

Like the original conditional operator, the conditional ref expression evaluates only one of the two expressions: either `consequent` or `alternative`.

In the case of the conditional ref expression, the type of `consequent` and `alternative` must be the same.

The following example demonstrates the usage of the conditional ref expression:

## Conditional operator and an `if..else` statement

Use of the conditional operator instead of an [if-else](../keywords/if-else.md) statement might result in more concise code in cases when you need conditionally to compute a value. The following example demonstrates two ways to classify an integer as negative or nonnegative:

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type cannot overload the conditional operator.

## C# language specification
