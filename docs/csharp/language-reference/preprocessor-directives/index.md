# C# preprocessor directives
This section contains information about the following C# preprocessor directives:

- [#if](./preprocessor-if.md)
- [#else](./preprocessor-else.md)
- [#elif](./preprocessor-elif.md)
- [#endif](./preprocessor-endif.md)
- [#define](./preprocessor-define.md)
- [#undef](./preprocessor-undef.md)
- [#warning](./preprocessor-warning.md)
- [#error](./preprocessor-error.md)
- [#line](./preprocessor-line.md)
- [#region](./preprocessor-region.md)
- [#endregion](./preprocessor-endregion.md)
- [#pragma](./preprocessor-pragma.md)
- [#pragma warning](./preprocessor-pragma-warning.md)
- [#pragma checksum](./preprocessor-pragma-checksum.md)

See the individual topics for more information and examples.

Although the compiler doesn't have a separate preprocessor, the directives described in this section are processed as if there were one. They are used to help in conditional compilation. Unlike C and C++ directives, you cannot use these directives to create macros.

A preprocessor directive must be the only instruction on a line.
