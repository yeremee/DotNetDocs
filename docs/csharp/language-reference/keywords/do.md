# do (C# Reference)

The `do` statement executes a statement or a block of statements while a specified Boolean expression evaluates to `true`. Because that expression is evaluated after each execution of the loop, a `do-while` loop executes one or more times. This differs from the [while](while.md) loop, which executes zero or more times.

At any point within the `do` statement block, you can break out of the loop by using the [break](break.md) statement.

You can step directly to the evaluation of the `while` expression by using the [continue](continue.md) statement. If the expression evaluates to `true`, execution continues at the first statement in the loop. Otherwise, execution continues at the first statement after the loop.

You can also exit a `do-while` loop by the [goto](goto.md), [return](return.md), or [throw](throw.md) statements.

## Example

The following example shows the usage of the `do` statement. Select **Run** to run the example code. After that you can modify the code and run it again.
