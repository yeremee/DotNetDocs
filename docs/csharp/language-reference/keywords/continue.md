# continue (C# Reference)

The `continue` statement passes control to the next iteration of the enclosing [while](./while.md), [do](./do.md), [for](./for.md), or [foreach](./foreach-in.md) statement in which it appears.

## Example

In this example, a counter is initialized to count from 1 to 10. By using the `continue` statement in conjunction with the expression `(i < 9)`, the statements between `continue` and the end of the `for` body are skipped.
