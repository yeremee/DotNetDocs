# -platform (C# Compiler Options)

Specifies which version of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) can run the assembly.

## Syntax

```console
-platform:string
```

## Parameters

`string` \
anycpu (default), anycpu32bitpreferred, ARM, x64, x86, or Itanium.

## Remarks

- **anycpu** (default) compiles your assembly to run on any platform. Your application runs as a 64-bit process whenever possible and falls back to 32-bit when only that mode is available.

- **anycpu32bitpreferred** compiles your assembly to run on any platform. Your application runs in 32-bit mode on systems that support both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. You can specify this option only for projects that target .NET Framework 4.5 or later.

- **ARM** compiles your assembly to run on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor.

- **ARM64** compiles your assembly to run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor that supports the A64 instruction set.

- **x64** compiles your assembly to be run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer that supports the AMD64 or EM64T instruction set.

- **x86** compiles your assembly to be run by the 32-bit, x86-compatible CLR.

- **Itanium** compiles your assembly to be run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer with an Itanium processor.

On a 64-bit Windows operating system:

- Assemblies compiled with **-platform:x86** execute on the 32-bit CLR running under WOW64.

- A DLL compiled with the **-platform:anycpu** executes on the same CLR as the process into which it is loaded.

- Executables that are compiled with the **-platform:anycpu** execute on the 64-bit CLR.

- Executables compiled with **-platform:anycpu32bitpreferred** execute on the 32-bit CLR.

The **anycpu32bitpreferred** setting is valid only for executable (.EXE) files, and it requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later.

For more information about developing an application to run on a Windows 64-bit operating system, see [64-bit Applications](../../../framework/64-bit-apps.md).

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the **Properties** page for the project.

2. Click the **Build** property page.

3. Modify the **Platform target** property and, for projects that target .NET Framework 4.5 or later, select or clear the **Prefer 32-bit** check box.

> [!NOTE]
> `-platform` is not available in the development environment in Visual C# Express.

For information on how to set this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.CSharpProjectConfigurationProperties3.PlatformTarget%2A>.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the **-platform** option to specify that the application should be run by the 64-bit CLR on a 64-bit Windows operating system.

```console
csc -platform:anycpu filename.cs
```
