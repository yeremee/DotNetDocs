# -out (C# Compiler Options)
The **-out** option specifies the name of the output file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```console  
-out:filename  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `filename`  
 The name of the output file created by the compiler.  
  
## Remarks  
 On the command line, it is possible to specify multiple output files for your compilation. The compiler expects to find one or more source code files following the **-out** option. Then, all source code files will be compiled into the output file specified by that **-out** option.  
  
 Specify the full name and extension of the file you want to create.  
  
 If you do not specify the name of the output file:  
  
- An .exe will take its name from the source code file that contains the **Main** method.  
  
- A .dll or .netmodule will take its name from the first source code file.  
  
 A source code file used to compile one output file cannot be used in the same compilation for the compilation of another output file.  
  
 When producing multiple output files in a command-line compilation, keep in mind that only one of the output files can be an assembly and that only the first output file specified (implicitly or explicitly with **-out**) can be the assembly.  
  
 Any modules produced as part of a compilation become files associated with any assembly also produced in the compilation. Use [ildasm.exe](../../../framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to view the assembly manifest to see the associated files.  
  
 The -out compiler option is required in order for an exe to be the target of a friend assembly. For more information see [Friend Assemblies](../../../standard/assembly/friend.md).  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1. Open the project's **Properties** page.  
  
2. Click the **Application** property page.  
  
3. Modify the **Assembly name** property.  
  
     To set this compiler option programmatically: the <xref:VSLangProj80.ProjectProperties3.OutputFileName%2A> is a read-only property, which is determined by a combination of the project type (exe, library, and so forth) and the assembly name. Modifying one or both of these properties will be necessary to set the output file name.  
  
## Example  
 Compile `t.cs` and create output file `t.exe`, as well as build `t2.cs` and create module output file `mymodule.netmodule`:  
  
```console  
csc t.cs -out:mymodule.netmodule -target:module t2.cs  
```
