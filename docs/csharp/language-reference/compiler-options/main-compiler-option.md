# -main (C# Compiler Options)

This option specifies the class that contains the entry point to the program, if more than one class contains a **Main** method.

## Syntax

```console
-main:class
```

## Arguments
 `class`  
 The type that contains the **Main** method.  
 The provided class name must be fully qualified; it must include the full namespace containing the class, followed by the class name. For example, when the `Main` method is located inside the `Program` class in the `MyApplication.Core` namespace, the compiler option has to be `-main:MyApplication.Core.Program`.

## Remarks

If your compilation includes more than one type with a [Main](../../programming-guide/main-and-command-args/index.md) method, you can specify which type contains the **Main** method that you want to use as the entry point into the program.

This option is for use when compiling an *.exe* file.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Properties** page.

2. Click the **Application** property page.

3. Modify the **Startup object** property.

    To set this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.ProjectProperties3.StartupObject%2A>.

### To set this compiler option by manually editing the *.csproj* file

You can set this option by editing the .csproj file and adding an element `StartupObject` inside the `PropertyGroup` section. For example:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <StartupObject>MyApplication.Core.Program</StartupObject>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

## Example

Compile `t2.cs` and `t3.cs`, specifying that the **Main** method will be found in `Test2`:

```console
csc t2.cs t3.cs -main:Test2
```
