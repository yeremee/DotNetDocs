# -highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)
The **-highentropyva** compiler option tells the Windows kernel whether a particular executable supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```console  
-highentropyva[+ | -]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `+` &#124; `-`  
 This option specifies that a 64-bit executable or an executable that is marked by the [-platform:anycpu](./platform-compiler-option.md) compiler option supports a high entropy virtual address space. The option is disabled by default. Use **-highentropyva+** or **-highentropyva** to enable it.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **-highentropyva** option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR. Using higher degrees of entropy means that a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps. As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.  
  
 When the **-highentropyva** compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process.
