# What's new in C# 7.2

C# 7.2 is another point release that adds a number of useful features.
One theme for this release is working more efficiently with value types by
avoiding unnecessary copies or allocations.

The remaining features are small, nice-to-have features.

C# 7.2 uses the [language version selection](../language-reference/configure-language-version.md) configuration element to select the compiler language version.

The new language features in this release are:

- [Techniques for writing safe efficient code](#safe-efficient-code-enhancements)
  - A combination of syntax improvements that enable working with value types using reference semantics.
- [Non-trailing named arguments](#non-trailing-named-arguments)
  - Named arguments can be followed by positional arguments.
- [Leading underscores in numeric literals](#leading-underscores-in-numeric-literals)
  - Numeric literals can now have leading underscores before any printed digits.
- [`private protected` access modifier](#private-protected-access-modifier)
  - The `private protected` access modifier enables access for derived classes in the same assembly.
- [Conditional `ref` expressions](#conditional-ref-expressions)
  - The result of a conditional expression (`?:`) can now be a reference.

The remainder of this article provides an overview of each feature. For each feature,
you'll learn the reasoning behind it. You'll learn the syntax. You can explore these features in your environment using the `dotnet try` global tool:

1. Install the [dotnet-try](https://github.com/dotnet/try/blob/master/README.md#setup) global tool.
1. Clone the [dotnet/try-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/try-samples) repository.
1. Set the current directory to the *csharp7* subdirectory for the *try-samples* repository.
1. Run `dotnet try`.

## Safe efficient code enhancements

Language features introduced in 7.2 let you work with value types
while using reference semantics. They
are designed to increase performance by minimizing copying value types without
incurring the memory allocations associated with using reference types. The
features include:

- The `in` modifier on parameters, to specify that an argument is passed by reference but not modified by the called method. Adding the `in` modifier to an argument is a [source compatible change](version-update-considerations.md#source-compatible-changes).
- The `ref readonly` modifier on method returns, to indicate that a method returns its value by reference but doesn't allow writes to that object. Adding the `ref readonly` modifier is a [source compatible change](version-update-considerations.md#source-compatible-changes), if the return is assigned to a value. Adding the `readonly` modifier to an existing `ref` return statement is an [incompatible change](version-update-considerations.md#incompatible-changes). It requires callers to update the declaration of `ref` local variables to include the `readonly` modifier.
- The `readonly struct` declaration, to indicate that a struct is immutable and should be passed as an `in` parameter to its member methods. Adding the `readonly` modifier to an existing struct declaration is a [binary compatible change](version-update-considerations.md#binary-compatible-changes).
- The `ref struct` declaration, to indicate that a struct type accesses managed memory directly and must always be stack allocated. Adding the `ref` modifier to an existing `struct` declaration is an [incompatible change](version-update-considerations.md#incompatible-changes). A `ref struct` cannot be a member of a class or used in other locations where it may be allocated on the heap.

You can read more about all these changes in [Write safe efficient code](../write-safe-efficient-code.md).

## Non-trailing named arguments

Method calls may now use named arguments that precede positional arguments when those
named arguments are in the correct positions. For more information see
[Named and optional arguments](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md).

## Leading underscores in numeric literals

The implementation of support for digit separators in C# 7.0
didn't allow the `_` to be the first character of the literal value. Hex
and binary numeric literals may now begin with an `_`.

For example:

```csharp
int binaryValue = 0b_0101_0101;
```

## *private protected* access modifier

A new compound access modifier: `private protected` indicates that a member may be
accessed by containing class or derived classes that are declared in the same assembly. While `protected internal`
allows access by derived classes or classes that are in the same assembly, `private protected`
limits access to derived types declared in the same assembly.

For more information see [access modifiers](../language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers.md) in the language reference.

## Conditional `ref` expressions

Finally, the conditional expression may produce a ref result instead of a value result. For example, you would write the following to retrieve a reference to the first element in one of two arrays:

```csharp
ref var r = ref (arr != null ? ref arr[0] : ref otherArr[0]);
```

The variable `r` is a reference to the first value in either `arr` or `otherArr`.

For more information, see [conditional operator (?:)](../language-reference/operators/conditional-operator.md) in the language reference.
