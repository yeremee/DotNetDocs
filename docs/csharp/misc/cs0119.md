# Compiler Error CS0119
'construct1_name' is a 'construct1', which is not valid in the given context.  
  
 The compiler detected an unexpected construct such as the following:  
  
- A class constructor is not a valid test expression in a conditional statement.  
  
- A class name was used instead of an instance name to refer to an array element.  
  
- A method identifier is used as if it were a struct or class  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0119.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0119.cs  
using System;  
public class MyClass
{  
   public static void Test() {}  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      Console.WriteLine(Test.x);   // CS0119  
   }  
}  
```
