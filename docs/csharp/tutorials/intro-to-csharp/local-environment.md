# Become familiar with the .NET development tools

The first step in running a tutorial on your machine is to set up a development environment.
The .NET tutorial [Hello World in 10 minutes](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro) has instructions for setting
up your local development environment on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

Alternatively, you can install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Basic application development flow

You'll create applications using the [`dotnet new`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-new.md) command. This command
generates the files and assets necessary for your application. The introduction to C# tutorials all use the `console` application type. Once you've got the basics, you can expand to other application types.

The other commands you'll use are [`dotnet build`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-build.md) to build the executable,
and [`dotnet run`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-run.md) to run the executable.

## Pick your tutorial

You can start with any of the following tutorials:

## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md)

In the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) tutorial, you'll learn
how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different
numeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding and how to perform
mathematical calculations using C#.

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) lesson.

## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md)

The [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md) tutorial teaches the basics of selecting
different paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the
basics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose
different actions.

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) and
[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) lessons.

## [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md)

The [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md) lesson gives you
a tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists.

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the lessons listed above.

## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)

This final introduction to C# tutorial is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.
You'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.
