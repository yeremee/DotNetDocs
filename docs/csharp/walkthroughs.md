# C# walkthroughs

Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.

 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.

## In this section

- [Process asynchronous tasks as they complete](./programming-guide/concepts/async/start-multiple-async-tasks-and-process-them-as-they-complete.md)\
  Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](./language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](./language-reference/operators/await.md).

- [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](/windows/uwp/winrt-components/walkthrough-creating-a-simple-windows-runtime-component-and-calling-it-from-javascript)\
  Shows how to create a Windows Runtime type, package it in a Windows Runtime component, and then call the component from a Windows 8.x Store app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.

- [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](./programming-guide/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md)\
  Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.

- [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](./programming-guide/types/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md)\
  Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.

- [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](../framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-authoring-a-composite-control-with-visual-csharp.md)\

  Describes how to debug the design-time behavior of your custom control.

- [Walkthrough: Perform common tasks using designer actions](../framework/winforms/controls/perform-common-tasks-design-actions.md)\
  Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a `TabControl`, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a `SplitContainer` control.

- [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](./programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)\
  Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write LINQ query expressions.
