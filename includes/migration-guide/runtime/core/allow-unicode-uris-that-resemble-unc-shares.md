### Allow Unicode in URIs that resemble UNC shares

#### Details

In <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=fullName>, constructing a file URI containing both a UNC share name and Unicode characters will no longer result in a URI with invalid internal state. The behavior will change only when all of the following are true:<ul><li>The URI has the scheme <code>file:</code> and is followed by four or more slashes.</li><li>The host name begins with an underscore or other non-reserved symbol.</li><li>The URI contains Unicode characters.</li></ul>

#### Suggestion

Applications working with URIs consistently containing Unicode could have conceivably used this behavior to disallow references to UNC shares. Those applications should use <xref:System.Uri.IsUnc> instead.
